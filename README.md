# FCG Editor

_The all-in one editor for Fluid Construction Grammar_

## About

The FCG editor, which is available for Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux, allows you to quickly install and test Fluid Construction Grammar without having to set up a complete Lisp programming environment or the Babel software architecture. It includes all of the essential functionalities of FCG for rapidly defining and visualizing constructions in your web browser, and to develop grammar fragments that you can use for language comprehension and production. You can download the FCG Editor for free at [this page](https://www.fcg-net.org/download/).

The FCG editor is based on a first design by Dr Remi van Trijp, and has since then been co-developed by the [Sony Computer Science Laboratories Paris](https://csl.sony.fr/), the [VUB Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://ehai.ai.vub.ac.be/) and the [Faculty of Informatics of UNamur](https://www.unamur.be/fr/info).
